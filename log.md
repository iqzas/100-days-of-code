##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)


### Day 1: Sep 21, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Basic HTML 80% on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I am experienced programmer starting to learn front end. so it was very basic things to complete the progress, want to get through the formality of the course.
